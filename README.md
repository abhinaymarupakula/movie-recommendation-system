Flask Project with Virtual Environment
This repository contains a Flask application that utilizes machine learning models stored as .pkl files. Follow the instructions below to set up the project, run the Flask app, and integrate with the ML models.

Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or later
pip (Python package manager)
Setup Instructions
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Linux/Mac:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt does not exist, create one and include packages like Flask, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn:

text
Copy code
Flask==2.3.3
pandas==1.5.3
numpy==1.24.3
scikit-learn==1.3.1
Step 4: Add Your .pkl Files
Place your .pkl files (e.g., ML models) in the appropriate directory, such as a models folder:

bash
Copy code
/models
    your_model.pkl
Step 5: Run the Flask Application
Start the Flask server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
